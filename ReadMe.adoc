== Overview

CIM4Diagram is an **Proof-of-concept project** focusing on creating a **LinkML-based definition** of the **CIM Diagram Profile**, aligned with *W3C DX-PROF*. This project aims to define a **vocabulary and constraints** for diagram modeling within the **Common Information Model (CIM)** framework, ensuring compatibility with existing semantic web standards.  

As part of this effort, we will:
- Define **CIM Diagram Profile** constraints using **LinkML**.
- Generate an **RDFS-Plus ontology** representation of the vocabulary.
- Generate an **SHACL** representation of the profile constraints 
- Investigate whether **LinkML** can be used to generate the expected ontology and contained defined in the target RDFS and SHACL definition that will be manually created. 
- Explore alternative generation from LinkML for providing necessary documentation and Software Development Kit (SDK) for the profile.  

== Objectives  

CIM4Diagram aims to:

- Develop a structured CIM Diagram Profile using **LinkML**, conforming to *W3C DX-PROF*.  
- Define a vocabulary and constraints for diagram representation in CIM with the expectation that we are able to provide all relevant modelling concept.  
- Generate an expected **RDFS-Plus** ontology for the profile and evaluate LinkMLâ€™s ability to produce it.  
- Investigate **SHACL** generation for enforcing constraints.  
- Assess additional semantic web technologies for supporting interoperability. 
- Investigate how LinkML can be used to make extension to the CIM standard.

== Expected Deliverables

- CIM Diagram Profile in LinkML, following W3C DX-PROF
- RDFS-Plus ontology generation from LinkML
- SHACL constraints for validation of diagram-related data
- Comparative analysis of SHACL, RDFS-Plus, and other ontology constraints
- Prototype implementation for querying CIM diagrams via SPARQL
